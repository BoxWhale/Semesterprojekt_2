This is the first generation build of Void Dweller, considered an early prototype or vertical slice, to test whether the mechanic is worth working on or not.
This build contains:
 - Base mechanic
	- Euclidian perspective
	- Node movement using BFS
	- Simple interactable code
 - Player
 - Single test level

This build lacks:
 - UI
 - Menu
 - A way to close the application
 - Multiple levels
 - Narration
 - Effects
 - Finalized player "Echo"
 - Companion

To run the application, simply run the execute file
To close the application, either use Task manager or press Alt + F4

How to play:
This is a simple prototype, made only to test the internal mechanics of the game:
Use LMB to select a place to go to.
Use RMB to interact with objects (So far only one interactable).
 - The only interactable in the game so far is the pillar to the down right of the players spawn position.
